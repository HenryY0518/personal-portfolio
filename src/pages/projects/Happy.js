                        The UBC Launch Pad is the best student-ran software developing club of UBC. I applied to the club as an UX designer towards the end of my first internship term in China because I wanted to improve my UX design skill set in a more structured and collaborative setting.

                        After some brainstorming and market research we decided to work on a new and improved version of the functional but outdated group scheduling product When2Meet.

                    <p>
                        Since we were not making a new product from scratch I proposed that we should mainly <strong>analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the existing When2Meet with usability tests</strong> while conducting some general user surveys to get a better understanding of the needs and desires of our potential target audience.

                    <p>
                        We conducted both remote and in-person usability tests on When2Meet with 5 volunteers of different familiarity with When2Meet. The findings were organized into three groups of sticky notes in Miro: whatâ€™s working well, what needs improvement, and feature suggestions.
